# Simple Password Strength Checker
>Password Strength Checker is a simple Python program that provides instant feedback on the strength of user-input passwords. It validates passwords based on length, the occurrence of uppercase and lowercase alphabets, numbers, and special characters. This project reflects my expertise regarding real-time input validation and regular expressions and how to develop intuitive security tools.
